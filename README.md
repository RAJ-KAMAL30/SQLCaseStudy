# Health Database Management System - Database Setup
# Overview
Welcome to the Health Database Management System (HealthDBMS) Database Setup README! In this document, you will find instructions for setting up the database to manage patient data for the healthcare organization.

# Database Setup Tasks
Tasks involve creating the database, implementing data security measures, and ensuring its functionality. Follow the steps below to complete tasks:

# Database Design: 
Review the provided data model in the problem statement. Based on the model, design a detailed database schema that includes tables for Patient, Medical History, Lab Results, Prescriptions, and Outcome.

# Choose a Database Management System (DBMS):
Select an SQL-based DBMS that best suits the project's requirements and is compatible with your technology stack. Options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.

# Install and Configure the DBMS:
Install the chosen DBMS on your system or server. Configure it according to the system requirements.

# Create the Database and Tables:
Use the database schema you designed to create the database and necessary tables.

# Data Security Measures: 
Implement data security measures to safeguard patient data. This includes encrypting sensitive data, setting up access controls, and ensuring regular data backups.

# Test Database Functionality:
Populate the database with sample patient data or test data. Perform thorough testing to ensure the database functions as expected and that data is stored and retrieved accurately.

# Getting Started
To get started with the database setup, follow the steps outlined above. If you encounter any challenges or have questions during the process, refer to relevant documentation or seek assistance from the team.

# Contributing
As this is a specific task for the database setup, contributions can be made by team members working on this part of the project. If you identify any improvements or optimizations for the database design or security measures, feel free to discuss them with the team.

# Library Management System
The Library Management System is a software application designed to help libraries manage their resources and provide an efficient borrowing and returning process for library patrons. This system allows library staff to organize, track, and maintain the library's collection of books, journals, and magazines. It also enables patrons to search for available resources and make reservations.

# Introduction
The Library Management System aims to streamline the operations of a library by providing a centralized platform for managing all aspects of the library's collection and services. It offers different access levels to accommodate library staff, patrons, and administrators.

# Features
# Library Staff

1. Add, update, and remove books from the library's collection.
2. Mark books as available or unavailable for borrowing.
3. Manage borrowing and returning of books for patrons.
# Patrons

1. Search for books based on titles, authors, genres, and more.
2. Make reservations for books that are currently unavailable.
3. View their borrowing history and due dates.
# Administrators

1. Access to all features available to library staff and patrons.
2. Monitor system activities and generate reports.
3. Manage user accounts and access permissions.
   
# Stakeholders

**The primary stakeholders of the Library Management System are:**

**Library Staff**: Responsible for managing the library's collection and assisting patrons with borrowing and returning books.

**Patrons**: Library members who use the system to search for books and borrow/return resources.

**Administrators**: Oversee the system's operations, manage user accounts, and ensure data integrity.

# Database Design
The system's database consists of several tables to store essential information:

**Books**: Contains details about each book in the library's collection.

**Borrowers**: Stores information about library patrons who borrow books.

**Loans**: Records the borrowing and returning of books by patrons.

**Reservations**: Manages book reservations made by patrons.

# How to Run
**To run the Library Management System**:

1. Install <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> on your computer.

2. Create the necessary database and tables using the provided SQL scripts.

3. Populate the tables with sample data using the INSERT INTO statements.

4. Launch the system application and start managing the library's collection.

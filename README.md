# Library Management System
The Library Management System is a software application designed to help libraries manage their resources and provide an efficient borrowing and returning process for library patrons. This system allows library staff to organize, track, and maintain the library's collection of books, journals, and magazines. It also enables patrons to search for available resources and make reservations.

# Introduction
